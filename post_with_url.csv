Ask your questions here and Olga will answer them here :)

Today at noon EST (6PM Kyiv time), Olga (/u/ukrainian_news), a teacher and parent from Odessa (now unfortunately displaced), will be here to answer questions and discuss her experience as a Ukrainian living through conflict. Olga is currently living as an IDP with her children, however her husband has been drafted into the armed forces.

We're glad to start what will hopefully be a fruitful AMA series with a conversation with Olga. Civilian perspectives are perhaps the single most important perspective to hear and understand during wartime.

Many preemptive thanks to Olga for taking the time to do this, and thanks to Lauren Drain as well for taking the time to put this together. You can watch a previous interview with Lauren and Olga here (from approximately 33:00 onwards): [https://www.facebook.com/LaurenDrain/videos/4982676885143188/](https://www.facebook.com/LaurenDrain/videos/4982676885143188/)
